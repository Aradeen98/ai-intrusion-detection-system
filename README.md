# 🛡️ AI-Intrusion-Detection-System  
*A Machine Learning Project for Detecting Network Intrusions Using Anomaly-Based AI Models*  

---

## 📘 Abstract  
Network intrusions remain one of the most critical challenges in cybersecurity.  
This project applies **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to detect suspicious network activity by identifying patterns of anomalies in data traffic.  
By leveraging the NSL-KDD dataset, this system classifies network connections as either *normal* or *malicious*, demonstrating how intelligent models can enhance cyber defense mechanisms.

## 🧪 Methodology  

**1. Dataset:** NSL-KDD (an improved version of the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion dataset).  
**2. Preprocessing:** Normalization and encoding of network connection features.  
**3. Models Tested:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network classifiers.  
**4. Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

Key libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
